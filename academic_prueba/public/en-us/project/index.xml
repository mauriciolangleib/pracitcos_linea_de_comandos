      <description>&lt;p&gt;The increasing pollution in the world is a serious problem with severe long-term consequences. The main sources of human-caused water pollution include mining, industry, livestock, and agriculture. In particular, the treatment and disposal of industrial waste requires complex processing that raises the costs of the final products. Due to this, there is a general interest for the development of bioremediation processes, which take advantage of the capacities of various microorganisms for the recovery of ecological niches. Shewanella spp. is a gram-negative bacterium of the gammaproteobacteria with a great potential for its application in bioremediation, as well as for energy generation. Shewanella is commonly found in aquatic environments and preferably marine sediments. To be competitive in this environment and respond to the low availability of resources, Shewanella has a complex regulation system and robust sensors, which can be applied both in the degradation of compounds and energy production processes. However, the stress generated by various external factors promotes new arrangements in the bacterial genome, mediated by the great variety of mobile elements they possess. The relationship between the versatility of this microorganism to adapt and survive against adverse environments and its ability to acquire and maintain mobile elements has not yet been studied. The objective of this project is to characterize the pangenome of Shewanella spp. From isolates collected from marine sediments from Antarctica, characterize the processes and cellular factors involved in the degradation of organic compounds and determine the role that mobile elements play in the evolution and adaptation of this bacterium to environmental changes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evolution of families of secretory proteins coding genes in Platyhelminthes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Parasitic flatworms generally have complex cycles involving various hosts, including humans and livestock species, and therefore have a great impact on human and animal health. Examples of species of this group of relevance are Echinococcus granulosus, Schistosoma mansoni, and Fasciola hepatica, among many others. These organisms have been studied in all aspects of their biology, but in relative terms of its impact, there is still much to do. Genomic and computational approaches have played a key role in keeping investigation moving at a low cost. Currently, there are genomes of several species that are available and there is also information on gene expression level. The study of genomes confirmed that duplication is a powerful evolutionary mechanism, generating raw material for the acquisition of new functions in the cell. In many cases, the increase of copies in a family of genes has proven to be the result of an adaptive process. Previous results suggest an important role of natural selection in the evolution of complex cycles in many flatworms and especially in some genes coding for excreted proteins. Through a comparative and functional genomic approach, this project aims to identify genes and families involved in the adaptive process at different stages of the cycle of different species to their specific niches (including aspects related to intermediate and final hosts) and quantify the effect of selection natural operating at the sequence level and the process of duplication in different lineages of flatworms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Functional and evolutionary genomics in Salmonella enterica, role of sRNA in lineage-specific pathogenicity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Salmonella enterica, a pathogen of birds and mammals, is distributed worldwide and has a considerable impact on human and animal health, being the main causal agent of foodborne infections. The different serotypes within the species show important differences in epidemic potential, virulence, and pathogenicity. The genetic bases of these differences are not fully understood, probably because they are the result of a combination of multiple genetic changes that have occurred throughout evolution. Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) are a class of gene expression regulators, conserved in bacteria, with less than 500 nucleotides in length. These elements primarily act as antisense RNAs on multiple target messenger RNAs and affect its translation process and/or stability. The development of massive sequencing and genomic strategies have made it possible to appreciate the role of these elements, involved in response to stress, regulation of metabolism, regulation of horizontal transfer, control of envelope composition, virulence in pathogens, among others. Despite its relevant role, few studies have exclusively addressed the comparative study of sRNAs and their network of regulated target mRNAs in S. enterica. This project proposes to study the evolution and variability of sRNAs and target mRNA within and between serotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genome wide association study (GWAS) in E. coli: an approach to the search for genetic markers of the Shiga toxin-producing pathotype (STEC)</title>
      <link>/en-us/project/ecoli_gwas/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to genetic changes, certain strains of E. coli have moved from commensals to pathogens. According to the pathogenic mechanisms involved, different pathotypes are recognized, one of them is STEC, a pathotype that produces Shiga toxins (Stxs). STEC infections occur at any age but in children under five years of age can produce severe processes such as hemorrhagic colitis (CH) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can be fatal in the acute stage or leave long-term sequelae. There is no specific treatment for STEC infection in humans and even the use of some antibiotics during the diarrheal phase can increase the chances of developing severe complications such as HUS or PPT. Thus, the most effective strategy so far is the prevention of the infection. On the other hand, the detection of STEC in raw meat for export is an important cause of alerts and has generated a block the import of products with very significant economic losses. In both cases, the diagnosis of the presence of this pathogen is essential. In currently used methods, whether in the clinic, in food and in livestock, the presence of stx and eae genes must be ensured in order to establish the pathogenic capacity of the strain. However, recently, stx positive and eae negative strains that have pathogenic capacity have begun to be identified worldwide, therefore thinking only about these genes when carrying out a screening has clear disadvantages to evaluate the potential pathogenic capacity of the crops involved. This project proposes a strategy based on in-silico analysis for the detection of genetic markers associated with the STEC pathotype. The GWAS technique will be implemented on freely available genomes, looking for kamers that are associated with: 1) the STEC pathotype and 2) the invasive STEC phenotype. The approach proposed in this project also includes the identification of non-coding markers such as regulatory regions, small RNAs, which despite being relevant for pathogenicity and virulence in bacterial pathogens are not well understood. Finally, using a bank of local strains and by sequencing complete genomes and / or amplification/sequencing of identified regions, we will proceed to validate the predictions in strains isolated from Uruguay.&lt;/p&gt;
