Foodborne diseases are one of the public health problems that occur most frequently in the population. Salmonellosis is a foodborne disease of worldwide distribution. Salmonella, in particular the S. enterica species, is an important food pathogen generating great problems in public health. The serotype of S. enterica associated with foodborne diseases most commonly isolated worldwide is S. enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis). During 1995-2001, Uruguay faced an epidemic of salmonellosis caused mainly by S. Enteritidis. Strikingly, S. Derby was isolated in food, but not in human infections. Frequently, S. Derby is also isolated as pathogen of salmonellosis. However, the current epidemiological situation of salmonellosis remains alarming due to several outbreaks nationwide. Due to the current local and regional epidemiological situation, it is urgent to know in depth the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the success of S. Enteritidis and S. Derby as a pathogen of foodborne disease. In 2019, we started a scientific project as part of my postdoctoral project in Montevideo (Uruguay). I perform functional genomic studies of S. Derby and S. Enteritidis isolates from human infection and egg sources.\n  Prediction of mobile genetic elements by machine learning algorithms. The idea that many prokaryotic genomes are mosaic, composed of a \u0026ldquo;central genome backbone\u0026rdquo; of essential and house-keeping genes (the core genome) interspersed with DNA segments constituting the \u0026ldquo;mobilome\u0026rdquo; (a variety of accessory genes that form part of the pan genome), is now common currency. The mobilome embraces several types of genetic unit which, as their collective name indicates, can move from place to place in a particular genome or from cell to cell. These mobile genetic elements (MGE) can be divided into two major groups: those, such as plasmids and bacteriophages, that are transmissible from cell to cell (the intercellular MGE), and those that cannot themselves undergo transfer but which are transferred following integration into members of the first group (the intracellular MGE). Intracellular MGE or transposable elements (TE) include transposons (Tn) and insertion sequences (IS) but can embrace integrons (In) and introns. Currently, we are developing bioinformatics software to predict the presence of ISs by machine learning methods. We are creating a well-done dataset of IS from the ISFinder database and enrichment with the GenBank database. This dataset will be allowed to train the algorithm to predict the presence and classify of IS in a different genome. The project is part of the Master of Data Mining (University of Buenos Aires, Argentina) thesis of the student Miguel Angel Barros that I the mentor.\n  Molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance mechanism on Gram-negative pathogens. Gram-negative bacteria cause infections including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis in healthcare settings. Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to multiple drugs and are increasingly resistant to most available antibiotics. These bacteria have built-in abilities to find new ways to be resistant and can pass along genetic materials that allow other bacteria to become drug-resistant as well. I study the genomic evolution and epidemiology of different gram-negative pathogen. Also, I study the antimicrobial resistance and virulence mechanism of gram-negative pathogen using genomic and bioinformatic approaches.\n  Evolutionary dynamic of Burkholderia contaminans during the chronic infection in cystic fibrosis patient. Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of more than 20 closely related bacterial species19. Bcc infection is associated with an accelerated decrease in lung function and body mass index, as well as an increased risk of mortality with respect to other pathogens associated with patients with CF. This fatal decrease when the patient is infected with Bcc is known as \u0026ldquo;cepacia syndrome\u0026rdquo; and has not been observed with any other pathogen associated with CF. The key determinants associated with this syndrome remain unknown; Bcc isolates can be recovered from patients with or without cepacia syndrome, suggesting that both bacterial and host factors play an important role in determining the clinical prognosis. Patients with CF who have chronic Bcc infection have a higher risk of mortality and a lower chance of eradicating said pathogen, and consequently have a lower chance of being included in lung transplantation programs. I study the evolutionary dynamic of B. contaminans during the chronic infection in cystic fibrosis patient.\n   Selected publications\n   Traglia GM, Place K, Dotto C, Fernandez JS, Montaña S, Bahiense CDS, Soler-Bistue A, Iriarte A, Perez F, Tolmasky ME, Bonomo RA, Melano RG, Ramírez MS.

De no ser así por favor instale en su computadora desde el ejecutable disponible en www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html. Una vez instalado siga los siguientes pasos:\na) Abra el programa PuTTY:\nb) Complete el dialogo los datos de usuario (incluyendo la dirección de IP) y N° de puerto, como se muestra a continuación.\nc) Guarde la sesión una vez le haya puesto nombre (ej. estud_lbc1) y cliquee en el botón “Save”.\nd) Para conectarse al servidor haga click en “Open”.\ne) Introduzca la palabra clave o password.\nResponda: En que lugar del sistema aparece?\n Desplazamiento en la Terminal. Comandos cd y pwd.  El comando “cd” (change directory) permite desplazarse dentro del sistema operativo, moviéndose entre carpetas, subiendo (hacia root) o bajando de nivel. El comando pwd (print working directory) imprime su ubicación en el sistema.\na) Para salir de la carpeta donde usted está ubicado, es decir para subir de nivel, escriba:\ncd ..  b) Para subir dos niveles, es decir salir de dos carpetas anidadas, escriba:\ncd ../..   Nota: recuerde el espacio luego del comando y separando argumentos\n c) Utilizando el comando “pwd” establezca su ubicación y escríbala a continuación: ………………………………….………………………………….\nd) ¿Puede seguir subiendo de nivel? Justifique su respuesta.\ne) Vuelva a la carpeta de su usuario con la opción a o b: a. cd /home/estudiantes o b. cd home y luego cd estudiantes\nf) Dibuje a continuación de forma muy esquemática y en un diagrama jerárquico el sistema de archivos de su lcb1 o lcb2 (no baje más de 3 niveles!).\n Comandos Básicos: ls, mkdir, cp, mv, y less, echo  El comando “ls” (list) permite enlistar el contenido de un directorio, con “mkdir” (make directory) genera nuevos directorios (o carpetas). “cp” (copy) y “mv”(move) permiten copiar y mover archivos,respectivamente. En el caso de “mv”, se puede utilizar para cambiar el nombre de un archivo o directorio.\nUtilizando “less” o “more” es posible visualizar el contenido de un archivo de texto, no modificarlo.\nFinalmente “echo” permite imprimir a la pantalla un texto o el contenido de una variable.\na) Generaremos un directorio dentro de la carpeta general del usuario “estudiantes” con su nombre y apellido, utilice “mkdir”. Dentro de esta carpeta cree una nueva con el nombre PRACT1.Recuerde no utilizar caracteres extraños como por ejemplo: ñ ; ¿ ^ $ “ ‘ = ( ] { á o espacio).\nmkdir andres_iriarte cd andres_iriarte mkdir PRACT1   Nota: cada estudiante trabajará en su carpeta!\n b) Entre en la carpeta recién creada utilizando el comando “cd” y luego utilizando el comando pwd establezca su path o dirección absoluta. Guarde en un archivo de texto este path.\ncd PRACT1 pwd  c) Desplazarse a la carpeta MATERIALES dentro del usuario “estudiantes” y dentro de ella a la carpeta Practico1.\nd) Utilizando el comando “ls” visualice todos los archivos presentes en la carpeta Practico1, /home/estudiantes/MATERIALES/Practico1/. Utilizando el carácter “*” puede enlistar todos los archivos terminados en “.fas” o “.aln” o todos los que comiencen con “seq”:\nls ls *.fas ls *.aln ls seq*  e) Visualice el primer archivo en formato fasta utilizando el comando “less”, y luego el primer archivo en formato clustalW. Cuantas secuencias contiene el primer archivo fasta y el segundo.\nless cpe.1000.fas less cpe.1001.fas  f) Copie, utilizando el comando “cp” todos los archivos que terminan en “.fas” a su carpeta personal (creada en a y cuyo path guardo en b):\ncp cpe.1000.fas /home/estudiantes/andres_iriarte/PRACT1/ cp cpe.1001.fas /home/estudiantes/andres_iriarte/PRACT1/ …  g) Copie, utilizando el comando “cp” todos los archivos que terminan en “.aln” a su carpeta personal (creada en a y cuyo path guardo en b). Esta vez utilice el carácter “*”.\ni) cp *.aln/home/estudiantes/andres_iriarte/PRACT1/   Nota: nuevamente recuerde los espacios y razone lo que está haciendo antes y después de ejecutar el comando.\n  ATAJOS O SHORCUTS: flechas arriba, abajo y tecla tabulador.  Un atajo en Linux es una combinación de una o varias teclas que realiza una función determinada. Los dos atajos más importantes son flecha arriba o abajo y tabulación. Las primeras permiten moverse dentro del historial de los comandos ejecutados en la terminal (los últimos 1000), es una forma de ahorrar tiempo y no volver a escribir los comandos ya ejecutados.\nLa tecla tabulación o Tab completa el texto de comandos, carpetas o archivos siempre y cuando estos estén accesibles en el path, es decir, pueda verlos desde donde estoy “parado” en el sistema de archivos.\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602637893,"objectID":"74533bae41439377bd30f645c4677a27","permalink":"/courses/example/example1/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/example/example1/","section":"courses","summary":"Docente: Dr Andrés Iriarte\n Conexión al Servidor vía SSH  1.

We used a genomic approach to study a set of isolates from different sources and years. Whole genome phylogeny showed that most of the strains are distributed in two major lineages (E1 and E2), both belonging to MLST sequence type 11 the major ST among serovar Enteritidis. Strikingly, E2 isolates are over-represented in periods of outbreak abundance in Uruguay, while E1 span all epidemic periods. Both lineages circulate in neighbor countries at the same timescale as in Uruguay, and are present in minor numbers in distant countries. We identified allelic variants associated with each lineage. Three genes, ycdX, pduD and hsdM, have distinctive variants in E1 that may result in defective products. Another four genes (ybiO, yiaN, aas, aceA) present variants specific for the E2 lineage. Overall this work shows that S. enterica serovar Enteritidis strains circulating in Uruguay have the same phylogenetic profile than strains circulating in the region, as well as in more distant countries. Based on these results we hypothesize that the E2 lineage, which is more prevalent during epidemics, exhibits a combination of allelic variants that could be associated with its epidemic ability.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Comparative genomics of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ST-11 isolated in Uruguay reveals lineages associated with particular epidemiological traits.
