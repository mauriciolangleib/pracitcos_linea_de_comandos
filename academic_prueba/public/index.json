Rhizobia are bacteria that fix gaseous nitrogen ($$N_2$$) after endosymbiotically established in nodules, generally root, of legumes. These bacteria form a phylogenetically diverse group located within the alpha and beta-proteobacteria, the latter being the least studied.\nDescribing and understanding the lineage-specific changes that occurred in the genome of different rhizobia is essential to fully understand the process of BNF in symbiosis. This project specifically aims to understand the process of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in $$\\beta$$-rhizobia, with special emphasis on genetic processes related to the recognition of the host plant and nodulation, using a transcriptomic tool, RNAseq. For this, a rhizobium of the genus Cupriavidus, previously isolated in our laboratory, and a species of the genus Mimosa as nodulation host will be used as a study model.\nThe RNAseq analysis is proposed in three key stages in the symbiosis process. The identification of the genes with differential expression obtained, as well as the immediate characterization that arises naturally from the metabolic pathways and/or related systems, will allow us to understand in more depth the biological process. With the data obtained, it is proposed to determine the similarities and differences between the associations established between alpha and beta-rhizobia with their host legumes.\n Selected publications\n   Improved glycerol to ethanol conversion by E. coli using a metagenomic fragment isolated from an anaerobic reactor, 2016 LOÁCES, I. , RODRIGUEZ, C. , AMARELLE, V. , FABIANO, E , NOYA, F  doi: \n  Est10: A Novel Alkaline Esterase Isolated from Bovine Rumen Belonging to the New Family XV of Lipolytic Enzymes (Completo, 2015) RODRIGUEZ, C. , LOÁCES, I. , AMARELLE, V , SENATORE, D , IRIARTE, A. , FABIANO, E , NOYA, F PLoS ONE, 2015.  doi: \n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1602716528,"objectID":"05d2abb595d14fa3b5a11302cec989bb","permalink":"/author/cecilia-rodriguez/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/cecilia-rodriguez/","section":"authors","summary":"Currently, within the framework of my PhD project, I am working on a line of research which is based on the study of BNF in $$\\alpha$$- and $$\\beta$$-proteobacteria.

Foodborne diseases are one of the public health problems that occur most frequently in the population. Salmonellosis is a foodborne disease of worldwide distribution. Salmonella, in particular the S. enterica species, is an important food pathogen generating great problems in public health. The serotype of S. enterica associated with foodborne diseases most commonly isolated worldwide is S. enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis). During 1995-2001, Uruguay faced an epidemic of salmonellosis caused mainly by S. Enteritidis. Strikingly, S. Derby was isolated in food, but not in human infections. Frequently, S. Derby is also isolated as pathogen of salmonellosis. However, the current epidemiological situation of salmonellosis remains alarming due to several outbreaks nationwide. Due to the current local and regional epidemiological situation, it is urgent to know in depth the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the success of S. Enteritidis and S. Derby as a pathogen of foodborne disease. In 2019, we started a scientific project as part of my postdoctoral project in Montevideo (Uruguay). I perform functional genomic studies of S. Derby and S. Enteritidis isolates from human infection and egg sources.\n  Prediction of mobile genetic elements by machine learning algorithms. The idea that many prokaryotic genomes are mosaic, composed of a \u0026ldquo;central genome backbone\u0026rdquo; of essential and house-keeping genes (the core genome) interspersed with DNA segments constituting the \u0026ldquo;mobilome\u0026rdquo; (a variety of accessory genes that form part of the pan genome), is now common currency. The mobilome embraces several types of genetic unit which, as their collective name indicates, can move from place to place in a particular genome or from cell to cell. These mobile genetic elements (MGE) can be divided into two major groups: those, such as plasmids and bacteriophages, that are transmissible from cell to cell (the intercellular MGE), and those that cannot themselves undergo transfer but which are transferred following integration into members of the first group (the intracellular MGE). Intracellular MGE or transposable elements (TE) include transposons (Tn) and insertion sequences (IS) but can embrace integrons (In) and introns. Currently, we are developing bioinformatics software to predict the presence of ISs by machine learning methods. We are creating a well-done dataset of IS from the ISFinder database and enrichment with the GenBank database. This dataset will be allowed to train the algorithm to predict the presence and classify of IS in a different genome. The project is part of the Master of Data Mining (University of Buenos Aires, Argentina) thesis of the student Miguel Angel Barros that I the mentor.\n  Molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance mechanism on Gram-negative pathogens. Gram-negative bacteria cause infections including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis in healthcare settings. Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to multiple drugs and are increasingly resistant to most available antibiotics. These bacteria have built-in abilities to find new ways to be resistant and can pass along genetic materials that allow other bacteria to become drug-resistant as well. I study the genomic evolution and epidemiology of different gram-negative pathogen. Also, I study the antimicrobial resistance and virulence mechanism of gram-negative pathogen using genomic and bioinformatic approaches.\n  Evolutionary dynamic of Burkholderia contaminans during the chronic infection in cystic fibrosis patient. Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of more than 20 closely related bacterial species19. Bcc infection is associated with an accelerated decrease in lung function and body mass index, as well as an increased risk of mortality with respect to other pathogens associated with patients with CF. This fatal decrease when the patient is infected with Bcc is known as \u0026ldquo;cepacia syndrome\u0026rdquo; and has not been observed with any other pathogen associated with CF. The key determinants associated with this syndrome remain unknown; Bcc isolates can be recovered from patients with or without cepacia syndrome, suggesting that both bacterial and host factors play an important role in determining the clinical prognosis. Patients with CF who have chronic Bcc infection have a higher risk of mortality and a lower chance of eradicating said pathogen, and consequently have a lower chance of being included in lung transplantation programs. I study the evolutionary dynamic of B. contaminans during the chronic infection in cystic fibrosis patient.\n   Selected publications\n   Traglia GM, Place K, Dotto C, Fernandez JS, Montaña S, Bahiense CDS, Soler-Bistue A, Iriarte A, Perez F, Tolmasky ME, Bonomo RA, Melano RG, Ramírez MS.

Nevertheless, its study across the tree of life is severely hindered by the problem of identifying the SL sequences that are being trans-spliced.**Results** In this paper we present SLFinder, a four-step pipeline meant to identify de novo candidate SL sequences making very few assumptions regarding the SL sequence properties. The pipeline takes transcriptomic de novo assemblies and a reference genome as input and allows the user intervention on several points to account for unexpected features of the dataset. The strategy and its implementation were tested on real RNAseq data from species with and without SL Trans-Splicing.**Conclusions** SLFinder is capable to identify SL candidates with good precision in a reasonable amount of time. It is especially suitable for species with unknown SL sequences, generating candidate sequences for further refining and experimental validation.","tags":["Selected publications"],"title":"SLFinder, a pipeline for the novel identification of splice-leader sequences: a good enough solution for a complex problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vico P.","Bonilla S.","Cremella B.","Aubriot L.","Iriarte A.","Piccini C."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602718557,"objectID":"bed44abdd7728c72079785025ef671e9","permalink":"/publication/vico_etal_2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vico_etal_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"*Raphidiopsis* (*Cylindrospermopsis*) *raciborskii*, a globally distributed bloom-forming cyanobacterium, produces either the cytotoxin cylindrospermopsin (CYL) in Oceania, Asia and Europe or the neurotoxin saxitoxin (STX) and analogues (paralytic shellfish poison, PSP) in South America (encoded by sxt genetic cluster) and none of them in Africa. Nevertheless, this particular geographic pattern is usually overlooked in current hypotheses about the species dispersal routes. Here, we combined genomics, phylogenetic analyses, toxicity data and a literature survey to unveil the evolutionary history and spread of the species. Phylogenies based on 354 orthologous genes from all the available genomes and ribosomal ITS sequences of the taxon showed two well-defined clades: the American, having the PSP producers; and the Oceania/Europe/Asia, including the CYL producers. We propose central Africa as the original dispersion center (non-toxic populations), reaching North Africa and North America (in former Laurasia continent). The ability to produce CYL probably took place in populations that advanced to sub-Saharan Africa and then to Oceania and South America. According to the genomic context of the sxt cluster found in PSP-producer strains, this trait was acquired once by horizontal transfer in South America, where the ability to produce CYL was lost.","tags":["Selected publications"],"title":"Biogeography of the cyanobacterium *Raphidiopsis* (*Cylindrospermopsis*) *raciborskii*: Integrating genomics, phylogenetic and toxicity data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

The α-β-α sandwich structure of the CAP domain is characteristic of this superfamily and several different domains may be found together with it. They are generally secreted proteins and in helminths many are secreted to the environment, and are related to the host-parasite interaction. In this work we mined cestode genomic data for members of this superfamily. Whereas in average 26 members with complete CAP domains were found in most cestodes, in Mesocestoides corti we strikingly found 271 members with complete domains, most of which show evidence of expression. We also found other truncated domains and putative pseudogenes. Interestingly, most of these genes were found in a monophyletic clade within a cestode-specific group of CAP domain containing proteins, and each cestode species has also developed independent duplications of these proteins. This pattern of extensive independent duplications can also be found in other parasitic and free-living flatworms, as well as in other metazoan phyla. Within the *M. corti* specific expansion, several sub-clades of these proteins showed evidence of evolution under positive selection. Our results suggest that the CAP domain containing proteins of animals evolve through a “birth and death” mechanism, and that different environmental pressures may drive this evolution in different species.
