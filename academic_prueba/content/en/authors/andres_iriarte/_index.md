The Computational Biology Lab belongs to the Biotechnology Department at the School of Medicine (Universidad de la República - Uruguay). We started our work as an independent group in the middle of 2016. 

Two national grants support our starting work, one founded by FCE- ANII, and the other by CSIC I+D UdelaR. Two young research assistants were hired at the beginning, then graduate students join our working team in two main lines of research: Functional al comparative genomics of platyhelminths and bacterial pathogens. During these years many national and international collaborations stand as a result our group is participating in exciting projects.
