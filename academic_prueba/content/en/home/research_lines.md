One of the main goals of comparative genomics is the elucidation of the genetic basis of the phenotypic differences among species and strains. The genomic approach is of particular importance when analyzing complex phenotypes that depend on a combination of several genetic elements, such as pathogenicity, virulence, or symbiosis. The genomic variability may include several levels (rearrangements, presence/absence of genes, indels, or single nucleotide variants). We study these genomic traits and their evolutionary dynamics in pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria, including clinical and environmental isolates of *Salmonella*, *Acinetobacter*, and *Shewanella*, among others.

The study of genomes confirmed that duplication is a powerful evolutionary mechanism, generating raw material for the acquisition of new functions in the cell. In many cases, the increase of copies in a family of genes has proven to be the result of an adaptive process. We have studied the evolution of gene families in Platyhelminthes and other phyla. Studies mainly include phylogenetic analyzes, gene structure identification, protein 3D prediction, and molecular distance estimations.
