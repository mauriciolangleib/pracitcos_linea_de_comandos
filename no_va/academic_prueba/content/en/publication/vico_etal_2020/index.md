abstract: '*Raphidiopsis* (*Cylindrospermopsis*) *raciborskii*, a globally distributed bloom-forming cyanobacterium, produces either the cytotoxin cylindrospermopsin (CYL) in Oceania, Asia and Europe or the neurotoxin saxitoxin (STX) and analogues (paralytic shellfish poison, PSP) in South America (encoded by sxt genetic cluster) and none of them in Africa. Nevertheless, this particular geographic pattern is usually overlooked in current hypotheses about the species dispersal routes. Here, we combined genomics, phylogenetic analyses, toxicity data and a literature survey to unveil the evolutionary history and spread of the species. Phylogenies based on 354 orthologous genes from all the available genomes and ribosomal ITS sequences of the taxon showed two well-defined clades: the American, having the PSP producers; and the Oceania/Europe/Asia, including the CYL producers. We propose central Africa as the original dispersion center (non-toxic populations), reaching North Africa and North America (in former Laurasia continent). The ability to produce CYL probably took place in populations that advanced to sub-Saharan Africa and then to Oceania and South America. According to the genomic context of the sxt cluster found in PSP-producer strains, this trait was acquired once by horizontal transfer in South America, where the ability to produce CYL was lost.'
